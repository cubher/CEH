CID
Block Cipher and Stream Cipher belongs to the symmetric key cipher.

one time pad (stream chiper) - uncrackable technique mathematically with certain conditions. basicallly works on XOR. key should be => then plaintext.

properties for good encryption
* confusion - small change in the key should change the chipertext
* diffusion - small change in plain text should change the chipertext

AES (Block Cipher) -
